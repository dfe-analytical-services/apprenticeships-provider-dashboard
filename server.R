# This is the server file.
#
# Use it to create interactive elements like tables, charts and text for your
# app.
#
# Anything you create in the server file won't appear in your app until you call
# it in the UI file. This server script gives examples of plots and value boxes
#
# There are many other elements you can add in too, and you can play around with
# their reactivity. The "outputs" section of the shiny cheatsheet has a few
# examples of render calls you can use:
